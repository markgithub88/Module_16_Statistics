## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Vehicle length and ground clearance have higher correlations to mpg.  The other variables are too small (negative values).

The slope of the model is not zero because p value is 5.35e-11 which is too small for a zero graph line.

Regarding the prediction of mpg, the answer is yes due to Multiple R-squared:  0.7149, which means 71% of the time the statistics are accurate.
