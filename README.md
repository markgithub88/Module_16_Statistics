Vehicle length and ground clearance have higher correlations to mpg.  The other variables are too small (negative values).

The slope of the model is not zero because p value is 5.35e-11 which is too small for a zero graph line.

Regarding the prediction of mpg, the answer is yes due to Multiple R-squared:  0.7149, which means 71% of the time the statistics are accurate.

Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
1. Lot 1 and 2 are in tolerance but 3 is definitely out of round.
2. Why?  Because of the effects of distribution
